ID,Potential Errors,Impact,Recommendations
"1","Incorrect or missing authentication. Lack of user permission management.","Unauthorized users may gain access, compromising security and data integrity.","Thorough testing for authentication mechanisms. Code reviews and static analysis to identify vulnerabilities.",
"2","Incorrect directory paths. Missing or incorrect file permissions (read/write/execute).","System instability due to missing dependencies. Potential security vulnerabilities if files have incorrect permissions.","Comprehensive testing of file operations. Verify directory paths and file permissions during deployment.",
"3","Inadequate permissions settings for critical processes or directories.","Processes may fail to execute, leading to system instability and operational issues.","Configure necessary permissions correctly and test thoroughly before deployment.",
"4","Logic errors in code causing incorrect behavior. Missing validation of input data (e.g., user inputs).","Incorrect operation or malfunction of critical functions, leading to data loss or security breaches.","Thorough testing for all logic paths. Implement robust input validation mechanisms.",
"5","Syntax errors in the command-line script. Missing paths or variables within the batch file.","Inability to perform necessary operations due to incorrect scripts or missing parameters.","Create and test batch files under different scenarios before deployment.",
"6","Incorrect logic for checking and setting values. Unintended side effects due to overwriting critical memory addresses.","System instability or crashes, leading to data loss and system downtime.","Implement robust validation checks and thorough testing of memory operations.",
"7","Logic errors in detecting whether an address has been set.","Unnecessary rewrites may cause inefficiencies or incorrect state management.","Thoroughly test the logic for detecting previously written values before deployment.",
"8","Incorrect logging mechanisms. Missing log entries due to bugs or incorrect handling.","Lack of audit trail, hindering troubleshooting and security audits.","Implement a comprehensive logging strategy with thorough testing and review.",
"9","Inadequate error messaging leading to confusion or incorrect user actions. Missing mechanisms for automatic restarts after repairs.","Potential prolonged downtime and increased operational burden.","Provide clear user guidance and implement automated recovery mechanisms where possible.",
"10","Incorrect configuration of SSH settings. Insecure SSH configurations leading to unauthorized access.","Security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized users to gain access to critical systems.","Conduct security audits regularly and ensure secure SSH configurations are in place.",
"11","Logic issues in detecting end-of-execution states. Incomplete or faulty session closure mechanisms.","Unintended persistence of open sessions, leading to security risks.","Implement robust detection logic for end-of-execution states and thorough testing of shutdown procedures.",
"12","Incorrect handling of network or file transfer operations. Missing error recovery mechanisms.","Data corruption due to failed transfers or repairs.","Thoroughly test the repair command execution process under various conditions."
